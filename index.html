            Goa has a fascinating historical past which dates back further to
            the 3rd century BC. A prominent part of the Mauryan Empire, Goa was
            of prime importance because of its natural harbours and wide river
            base. Only in 1987 did Goa get the status of an independent state
            and the regional language Konkani was recognized as one of India's
            official languages. A former Portuguese colony, Goa is also fondly
            known as the 'Rome of the East'. Inhabited and colonized by the
            Portuguese for almost 450 years, the culture of Goa is distinctly
            different from that of the rest of the nation. Here is a quick
            run-down of the rich and varied heritage of Goa.

            Goa is a state in western India with coastlines stretching along the
            Arabian Sea. Its long history as a Portuguese colony prior to 1961
            is evident in its preserved 17th-century churches and the area’s
            tropical spice plantations. Goa is also known for its beaches,
            ranging from popular stretches at Baga and Palolem to those in
            laid-back fishing villages such as Agonda.

            Shigmo in Goa: The Shigmo festival, also known as Shigmotsav is a
            spring festival celebrated in Goa. The Shigmo parades consist of
            traditional folk and street dancers and elaborately built floats
            depicting scenes from regional mythology and religious scenes. Goa’s
            answer to the festival of colours, Shigmotsav can be termed a fusion
            between Holi and Carnival. It is the biggest festival for Hindus and
            is spread over a fortnight.

            Unlike cosmopolitan cities in India, the locals of Goa live a
            beautiful and leisurely life, living each moment to the fullest.
            Reaping the benefits of its location, the most common occupation of
            locals is fishing. Owing to the fertile land and abundant water
            supply, often locals practice farming and grow common food items
            like cashew, coconuts, jackfruit and other grains. Apart from this,
            the next most sought-after businesses in Goa are locally-run shacks,
            guest houses, and tourist guide businesses. To sustain themselves in
            the offseason they practice the cultivation of local crops and
            grains.

            One of the best festivals in not just the state of Goa but also the
            whole of India, Goa Carnival draws people in droves. This unique
            festival has been celebrated since the 18th century after it was
            introduced by the erstwhile Portuguese rulers of Goa. Music, dancing
            and revelry make up this three-day non-stop extravaganza in the
            state. Colourful parades with floats are taken out all over Goa.

            Food and drinks are an integral part of marking Goa's vibrant
            culture. Meals bring families together, and a staple is the
            combination of Goan fish curry and rice. Apart from this staple, Goa
            is also famous for its mixed bag of freshly caught seafood. Prawns,
            crabs, kingfish with their traditional spicy marination are a
            delectable delicacy for the locals.
